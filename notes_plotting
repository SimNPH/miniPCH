Plotting for miniPCH objects:

* use base::curve and the functions from the object
* select functions to plot, use reasonable default (survival, hazard, density)
* choose x-limit (heuristic depending on the time intervals or quantiles)
* pass ... on to curve
* additional function (not plot method) to plot states and transitions for mutlistate models
* use par.mfrow to arrange plots

Use ggplot2 autoplot if ggplot is available:

* need to check if ggplot2 is available or the s3 generic just not available if ggplot2 is not available?
* arrange with facets or other method of arranging?

Summary for miniPCH objects:

* report time intervals
* report hazard rates
* how to report transition / generator matrix?
* report summary statistics like mean and average survival times?

All:

* Register Methods with UseMethod, roxygen2 and Description

Tests:

* 100% test coverage before merge into master
* how to test plots -> minimum, no errors
* compare ggplot object
* test text output of summary
