Plotting for miniPCH objects:

* additional function (not plot method) to plot states and transitions for mutlistate models

Use ggplot2 autoplot if ggplot is available:

* need to check if ggplot2 is available or the s3 generic just not available if ggplot2 is not available?
* arrange with facets or other method of arranging?

Summary for miniPCH objects:

* report time intervals
* report hazard rates
* how to report transition / generator matrix?
* report summary statistics like mean and average survival times?

All:

* Register Methods with UseMethod, roxygen2 and Description

Tests:

* 100% test coverage before merge into master
* test text output of summary
* how to test plots:
  * test plots for pch and multistate objects
  * vdiffr for base plot and ggplot autoplot
  * inspect layers, etc. for ggplot object
  * check if printing works
    * is printing automatically done if vdiffr snapshot is made?
